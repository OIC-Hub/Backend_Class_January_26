What is really happening?

When a client sends data to the server (POST, PUT, DELETE):

{
  "name": "Samuel",
  "subject": "Math"
}

Node.js does NOT receive this data in one piece.

Instead, Node.js receives it in small pieces called chunks.


Think of it like WhatsApp voice notes

Imagine someone sends you a long voice note:

It doesn’t arrive instantly

It comes in parts

Your phone joins the parts together before playing it
Chunks work the same way


let body = "";

req.on("data", chunk => {
    body += chunk;
});

Line-by-line explanation:

req.on("data")

This listens for incoming data

chunk

A small piece of the request body

body += chunk

We join all the pieces together
